# Stable-Diffusion-temperature-settings
Provides the ability to set the temperature for both UNET and CLIP. For ComfyUI.

I also added a togglable function compatible with SD 1.x models and SDXL/Turbo which helps to preserve quality weither it is for downscaling or upscaling.

## Usage

Like any other model patch:

## CLIP temperature at 0.75, 1 and 1.25. Prompt "a bio-organic living plant spaceship"
